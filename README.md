# Intelligent-Traffic-Control-using-Computer-Vision-Algorithms
The project titled "Intelligent Traffic Control using Computer Vision Algorithms" involves the development of a smart traffic management system that dynamically adjusts traffic light signals based on real-time road congestion levels. Utilizing advanced object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5, the system processes video feeds captured from real-world traffic scenarios to detect vehicle density at intersections. YOLOv5 demonstrated superior performance, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of approximately 90% at 0.5, outperforming Faster R-CNN, which plateaued around 75% after 5 training epochs. The model was trained on an expanded dataset and integrated into a physical traffic signal prototype using Arduino. Implemented in Python using tools like OpenCV, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab, the system effectively improves traffic flow, minimizes idle wait times, and demonstrates the potential of computer vision in urban traffic automation.
